# JS-D007 Fix: Bad usage of RegExp#exec and String#match

## Issue Description

DeepSource identified 2 occurrences of bad usage of `RegExp#exec` and `String#match` in the repository. These methods should only be used when we need to capture parts of a string that match a specific pattern. When we only need to check if a pattern exists, we should use `RegExp#test()` instead.

## Root Cause

The issue was located in generated service worker files in the `dev-dist/` directory:

1. **dev-dist/workbox-e39e166f.js:628**
   ```javascript
   const result = regExp.exec(url.href);
   if (!result) {
     return;
   }
   ```
   This code was using `.exec()` but only checking if a match exists, not using the captured groups.

2. **dev-dist/workbox-e39e166f.js:1149**
   ```javascript
   if (new RegExp(`${wildcards}`).exec(valueToCheck)) {
     // ...
   }
   ```
   This code was using `.exec()` in a boolean context without using capture groups.

## Why This Was a Problem

- These files are auto-generated by Workbox (via vite-plugin-pwa) during development
- The `dev-dist/` directory should never be committed to version control
- These files were being tracked in git, exposing the generated code to analysis
- The Workbox library code contains the inefficient regex patterns (not our source code)

## Solution

We fixed this issue by:

1. **Adding `dev-dist` to `.gitignore`**
   - Prevents generated files from being tracked in the future
   - These files are regenerated automatically during development

2. **Removing tracked dev-dist files from git**
   - Removed 4 files: `registerSW.js`, `sw.js`, `workbox-414b1829.js`, `workbox-e39e166f.js`
   - Deleted 9,811 lines of generated code from the repository

## Verification

After the fix:
- ✅ No tracked files contain `.exec()` or `.match()` patterns used for existence checking
- ✅ All source code already uses `.test()` correctly:
  - `src/lib/crypto.ts:150`: `/^\d{4}$/.test(pin)` ✓
  - `src/app/pages/parent/ChildManagement.tsx:65`: `/^[a-zA-Z0-9]+$/.test(username)` ✓
  - `src/app/pages/parent/ChildManagement.tsx:70`: `/^[a-zA-Z]/.test(username)` ✓
- ✅ TypeScript compilation passes
- ✅ The only `.match()` usage in source code is `cache.match()` which is the Cache API, not regex

## Best Practices

When working with regular expressions:

### ✅ Correct Usage

Use `.test()` when you only need to know if a pattern matches:
```javascript
if (/^\d{4}$/.test(pin)) {
  // PIN is 4 digits
}
```

Use `.match()` or `.exec()` when you need captured groups:
```javascript
const matches = email.match(/^(.+)@(.+)$/);
if (matches) {
  const [, username, domain] = matches;
  // Use captured groups
}
```

### ❌ Incorrect Usage

Don't use `.exec()` or `.match()` for boolean checks:
```javascript
// BAD - uses exec but doesn't use captured groups
if (regExp.exec(str)) {
  // ...
}

// GOOD - use test instead
if (regExp.test(str)) {
  // ...
}
```

## Impact

This fix:
- ✅ Eliminates the DeepSource JS-D007 violations
- ✅ Reduces repository size by removing ~9,800 lines of generated code
- ✅ Follows best practices for version control (don't commit generated files)
- ✅ Has no impact on functionality (files are regenerated during development)
- ✅ Improves code quality score

## Related Files Modified

- `.gitignore` - Added `dev-dist` to ignore list
- Removed 4 generated files from `dev-dist/` directory
